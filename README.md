Image Recognition System

Objective
Develop an image recognition system that can classify images into predefined categories. The system allows users to upload an image and predicts its class accurately.

Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras / PyTorch
- OpenCV
- Flask (for deployment)

Skills Required
- Deep Learning
- Computer Vision
- Python Programming
- Data Preprocessing

Project Steps

1. Collect Data
- Gather a dataset of images labeled with their respective categories.
- Example datasets: CIFAR-10, ImageNet, Kaggle datasets.

2. Preprocess Data
- Normalize images (scale pixel values to 0–1).
- Resize images to a fixed dimension (e.g., 224x224).
- Apply data augmentation (rotation, flipping, zoom) to increase dataset size and improve model robustness.

3. Build the Model
- Design a convolutional neural network (CNN) with layers: Conv → ReLU → MaxPooling → Flatten → Dense → Softmax.
- Optionally, use pretrained models like VGG16 or ResNet50 for transfer learning.

4. Train the Model
- Split data into training, validation, and test sets.
- Use an optimizer like Adam and loss function like categorical crossentropy.
- Train for multiple epochs while monitoring accuracy and loss.

5. Evaluate & Fine-Tune
- Evaluate performance on validation/test data.
- Adjust hyperparameters, add dropout or batch normalization, or fine-tune learning rates as needed.

6. Deployment
- Use Flask to build a simple web app.
- Users can upload an image → the model predicts the category → display results.
- Optional: Extend to multi-object detection with YOLO for advanced use.

Outcome
- A fully functional image classification system.
- Users can upload images and get predictions for predefined categories.
- Can be extended for real-world applications like face recognition, object detection, and scene classification.
